# Testing
## Jest
### As my coding journey continues I am teaching myself how to test my code. First up is Jest.
* Three tests to add (sum.test.js)
* Three tests to compare a string to a reversed string (isPalindrome.test.js)
* Three tests to check that a string is reversed (reverseString.test.js)
* A test to compare objects (shallowObjClone.test.js)
## Vitest
* Three tests to find the higher number
* Four tests for the classic Fizz Buzz game
* Four tests to find the average of an array of numbers
* Five tests to find the fatorial of varuois numbers
