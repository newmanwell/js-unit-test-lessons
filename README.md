# Testing
## Jest
### As my coding journey continues I am teaching myself how to test my code. First up is Jest.
* Three tests to add (sum.test.js)
* Three tests to compare a string to a reversed string (isPalindrome.test.js)
* Three tests to check that a string is reversed (reverseString.test.js)
* A test to compare objects (shallowObjClone.test.js)
* Four tests to find the longest word in an array (longestWord.test.js)
## Vitest
### All tests (max, fizzBuzz, calculateAverage, calculateFactorial, findLargestNumber are in intro.test.js)
* Three tests to find the higher number
* Four tests for the classic Fizz Buzz game
* Four tests to find the average of an array of numbers
* Five tests to find the fatorial of varuois numbers
* Five tests to find the largest number in an array
* Test Driven Developemnt method was used in the last three
## Playwright
### Starting by making a test on bbc.com
* Four clicks
* One screenshoot saved to the folder
* One video of whole process also saved
* Left headless as false for now### Test for my Todo
* Add three items
* Delete two items and verify they are no longer in the list
* Take screenshot of final list with just one item
