## Jest
### As my coding journey continues I am teaching myself how to test my code. First up is Jest.
* A test to add (sum.test.js)
* A test to compare a string to a reversed string (isPalindrome.test.js)
* A test to check that a string is reversed (reverseString.test.js)
* A test to compare objects (shallowObjClone.test.js)
